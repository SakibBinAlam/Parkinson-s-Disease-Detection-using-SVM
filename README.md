# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-using-SVM
Building a Machine Learning System that can detect Parkinson's Disease with Python. In this use case, Support Vector Machine model is used for prediction.

'Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset' is used in this prediction. This was collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nidaguler/parkinsons-data-set)

The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in
collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver,
Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the
feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.
